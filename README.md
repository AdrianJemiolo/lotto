# lotto
# The 'lotto.js' file manages the entire game process. First, it checks if the user has picked exactly 6 numbers. If yes, when the user clicks 'Draw', the game picks numbers. Then, it shows the drawn numbers and the user's choices. It also tells how many numbers match. If none match, it gives a message.
